                <p><strong>Fifth Year</strong></p>
                <p>Undertook an Erasmus traineeship in Toulouse, France. I was responsible for researching the use of activated carbon fibers	for	adsorbing	the	mycotoxin	‘Ochratoxin	A’	from	red	wine. The project involved weekly liaisons with supervisors to further project goals and the production of clear, concise technical reports which have now been published in an academic	journal.	In	first	semester,	studied	modules	in	safety	management practices, nuclear engineering, petroleum engineering and programming & optimisation alongside two modules that involve research of future chemical engineering technologies.</p>
                <p><strong>Fourth Year</strong></p>
                <p>Undertook modules on particle technology, multiphase systems, advanced separations and process control. As part of a team took part in the complete design of a sugar beet to bioethanol plant, from initial scoping through individual detailed design of an anaerobic digester, then to a project review and economic analysis.</p>
                <p><strong>First, Second and Third Year</strong></p>
                <p>Gained a strong understanding of the fundamental principles of Chemical Engineering and undertook regular laboratory work. Then applied knowledge to practical chemical engineering operations; including reactor design and the preliminary design of a chemical process.</p>
